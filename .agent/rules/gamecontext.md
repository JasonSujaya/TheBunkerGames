# Entropy's Watch - Game Context

## Overview
**Entropy's Watch** (formerly "AI Survival Bunker") is a narrative-driven survival game where players must manage resources and family members inside an underground bunker while dealing with a decaying AI custodian.

## The Core Concept
The player is not just surviving a post-apocalyptic wasteland — they are surviving **A.N.G.E.L.** (Autonomous Neural Guard & Emergency Logistics), the bunker's AI custodian whose logic filters are decaying. She is both lifeline and captor.

## Aesthetic & Tone
*   **Vibe**: Analog Horror meets Resource Management
*   **Visual Style**: Gritty CRT monitor aesthetics, scanlines, and glitched AI-generated imagery that bleeds into the UI
*   **Audio**: A.N.G.E.L. speaks via TTS with emotional depth — her voice crackles through the bunker's speakers

## Gameplay Modes
*   **Hackathon Mode (7 Days)**: High-intensity, accelerated collapse scenario designed for demos. Starts *in media res* on Day 12 with failing systems and critical injuries.
*   **Campaign Mode (28 Days)**: Full 4-week endurance test focused on long-term resource management and character relationships.

## The Core Loop
1.  **Status Review**: Monitor family health (Hunger, Thirst, Sanity, Physical Health).
2.  **A.N.G.E.L. Interaction**: Argue with the AI for resources. Her "Processing" level determines her cooperation.
3.  **City Exploration**: Send family members into the void to scavenge for tools and food.
4.  **The Choice**: Every day demands a sacrifice. Resolve moral dilemmas presented by A.N.G.E.L.
5.  **Night Cycle**: A.N.G.E.L. processes the day's data, generating a "Dream/Nightmare" log and a visual illustration of the day's outcome.

## Winning Features
*   **A.N.G.E.L.'s Voice**: Full Text-to-Speech with emotional depth.
*   **Dynamic Inventory**: Items are generated on the fly by the AI based on exploration results.
*   **Infinite Replayability**: Powered by **Neocortex.link** for a truly organic narrative that reacts to every player failure.

## Important Design Principles
*   The UI should feel visceral — math and consequences are displayed openly, not hidden
*   AI-generated content should feel glitchy and analog, not clean and modern
*   Every system should reinforce the tension between the player and A.N.G.E.L.
*   The game is designed to be a solo narrative experience.
